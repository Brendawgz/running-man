My very first attempt at programming something. Simple and fun iOS game. 

Learnt lots from this experience:
  - Before writing any code:
    - Plan out the specifications of the app such as what features and how many pages will it have, & what user inputs are required.
    - After figuring out the specifications, think about what code will be needed.
  - Writing code:
    - Always keep in mind extensibility and efficiency of the code (Avoid long loops and conditional statements). 
    - COMMENT code.
  - Programming is an iterative process, not linear. Constantly review your code as you write and think whether there's a better method.
  - Too much technologies and syntax to memorize, know the basics but don't try to memorize everything. 
  - Depending on the job/application, you might need to learn a new technology/programming language.
  
In hindsight, could have developed much better. Code is functional but inefficient.
